Run the `create_data.sh` script. But make sure you are not in a bio-clip docker container.

This requires an instance with ~300GB disk. The more CPUs the better for creating the dataset, you will need ~64GB RAM at least.

Note: There may be small changes to make in paths in the shell script, I did not have time to test these scripts end to end.
